# Coinbase_Pro_Sandbox_API
This is an application that I developed around the coinbase pro sandbox api. The application will automatically create buy and sell trades for your account.

Before running this application please download all of the npm packages required by running "npm install package.json"

After the all of the packages have been downloaded go into the sandBoxAPP.js file and add your key, secret, and passphrase to the authentication section of the file.

Once the authentication section has been filled out the application is ready to go. Just run "node sandBoxAPP.js" The application will begin by asking you if you would like to buy or sell. After that it will guide you through a series of question that will help build your trade.
